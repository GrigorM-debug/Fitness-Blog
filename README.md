        - To stop the server just press __Ctrl + C__ and the server will stop
    2. Running the project
        - Open new terminal
        - Write __cd client__ to go to the client folder
        - Write __npm install__ ot the short version __npm i__ to install all dependencies
        - To start the project write __npm run dev__
        - If you want to stop the project press __Ctrl + C__ in the terminal
